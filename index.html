<h1 align="center">Our Data</h1>
<p class = "intro"> When a student walks into the Speaking Center to be assisted by one of out many wonderful coaches, our first step in the process is to record information about the visit. The purpose of this website is to make the analysis of these data easily accessible to anyone who wants to see it.

<p class="context">The exact situation of the center has been changing rather quickly- we began with no official space in January 2013. We soon picked up our current space in Malloy 103 and were able to get semi-comfortable in our self-promotion campaign in 2014 and 2015, but our internal appointment system has just changed, and we are set to begin operating in a new space in fall 2017. This has put an inherent weakness behind the data- since our situation has been evolving over time the data from each semester aren't truly 100% comparable with one another, and any projections we make will fail to take into account recent changes.

<p class="context">With those caveats, here are afew snaoshots of the current operations of the USF Speaking Center.
